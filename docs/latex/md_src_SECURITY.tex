The application white check mark is still in support, without it means there version will no longer have a update including security fixture. That\textquotesingle{}s beacuse currently I have a job and a hard learning plain, which means I don\textquotesingle{}t have too much time to dealing with this project now, sincerely, I am sorry for that. Maybe this situation will get better in the future. So it is recommand to use the latest version.

According to security concern and my limiting time to contributing, \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceGpgFrontend}{Gpg\+Frontend}} will gradually drop the support of some old platforms.

Starting from v1.\+0.\+0, x32 operating system is no longer support. Mainly because I have limit time and the fact that x32 machime is getting less and less in the pc market, so I plan to stop spending tons of time dealing with lots of complex problem which might made me crazy. x64 is just enough, or you can use gpg4usb.

Starting from v2.\+0.\+1, Ubuntu 16.\+04 is no longer support. Mainly because this Ubuntu 16.\+04 LTS\textquotesingle{}s life time had come into an end at during that time. Keep using this version of Ubuntu is not safty anymore.

Starting from v2.\+1.\+0, mac\+OS 10.\+15 is no longer support. Mainly because this system will no longer support by github action in the near future. Also, I think this version is old enough to drop it out, and Apple might not longer to support it soon.\hypertarget{md_src_SECURITY_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Reporting a Vulnerability}\label{md_src_SECURITY_autotoc_md3}
If you want to report a vulnerability, it\textquotesingle{}s not good to raise an issue in public. You should send an email to \href{mailto:eric@bktus.com}{\texttt{ eric@bktus.\+com}} to contract me. In the email, You can describe the vulnerability you have just discovered and request a hot-\/fix. Or you can just provide a git patch to fix it and send it to me using the email. This is a better way to solve the vulnerability as quick as possible.
